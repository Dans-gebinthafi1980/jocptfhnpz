OMG dude, I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 It Feeds and I'm like, holy hell, what did we just see? 😂 Like, part of me wants to be all clever and make some deep analysis, but honestly, I’m just left with a bunch of “WTF” moments swirling in my brain. That clown thing with the teeth? NOPE. Hard pass. Why do they always think adding more teeth makes it scarier? Like we get it, you’re trying to be creepy. 🙄

> And can we talk about that ending? Whaaaaat was that? I mean, I was lowkey into the mystery part, you know, with everyone trying to figure out what was behind those attacks. But then they just dropped that random plot twist like, here you go, deal with it. I literally laughed out loud. And that’s not usually what you wanna do at the climax of a horror  , right? 😅

Speaking of random, did you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦? I legit couldn’t remember if I 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮ed it or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed it. But I mean, whatever, it was loads of chaotic fun in like a “what even” kind of way. There was this bit where the protagonist was running down that endless hallway for like, who knows how long, and I was just sipping my drink thinking, “Run faster, bro!” 🤣

And those special effects... whew. I dunno if they were going for retro or just totally missing the mark. It had this weird charm though. Like, you know when a   knows it’s kinda bad but just rolls with it? Yeah, exactly like that. That one scene where the shadow monster emerged from the mirror—I swear I thought my screen froze for a sec! Maybe it was just my internet acting up. 😂

Anyway, I’ll probably be stuck thinking about this until I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 another   to cleanse my brain. Might need something with a furry pet. You down for something tamer next time? Lemme know! 🤟
